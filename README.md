# hollow-bomservice
Hollow bomservice is a service that can store device build of materials (BOM) information that is provided by the vendors.  BOMs usually contain information like serial numbers, model numbers, components information, mac addresses and bmc credentials.  The information is often provided in formats such as PDF, XLSX or CSV.  This service is intended as a central place to store the BOMs as they are received by procurement or data center teams and shared with operations teams so they can provide support in the provisioning platform.
